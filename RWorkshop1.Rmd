R Technology Workshop
===
**R is the most popular free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that can be used to produce publication-quality graphics. This workshop is designed to introduce you to R and ggplot as well as RStudio, KnitR, Slidify, and Shiny.  
R is a central piece of the Big Data Analytics Revolution, for example, see http://opensource.com/business/14/7/interview-david-smith-revolution-analytics for an article entitled "Big data influencer on how R is paving the way"**

###This is how my RStudio is configured:
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

You also need to install LaTeX if you want to generate PDF files from KnitR.
